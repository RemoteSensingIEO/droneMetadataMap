## Coastal Drone Metadata Map

This platform is a collaborative effort to make coastal drone orthomosaics accessible, providing insight into areas where flights have already been conducted and helping to avoid duplicating efforts. It showcases the metadata of photogrammetric flights carried out by contributing institutions, allowing users to consult flight dates, extents, and other key information. A small preview image of each orthomosaic will be displayed, though the full orthomosaic itself is not available here. To access the complete orthomosaics and make data sharing easier, please contact the listed representative.

All metadata and orthomosaic previews will be available under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en). Contributing institutions will determine whether to share the full orthomosaics and will establish the licensing terms for their use.
